# BuildersDNA

## Description
I was tasked to build a modern, high-performance website to accomplish 3 goals:
* Build a consumer facing website to begin to establish a web presence
* Optimize traffic conversion to take call to action
* Integrate analytics and marketing tools to track user behavior

```
Due to the company shutting down the website is no longer live.
However, [here is a web archive link](https://web.archive.org/web/20240522114427/https://www.buildersdna.com/) I was able to find.
Web archive takes about 6-10 seconds to load in all assets. 
```

If the link doesn’t load, I’ve captured a screenshot and saved it as a PDF for easy viewing.
